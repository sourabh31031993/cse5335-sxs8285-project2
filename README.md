1) What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?

  The database used for this project is Mongodb. Mongodb enables horizontal scalability using a technique called sharding. It distributes the data across physical partitions to over come the hardware limitations. The data is automatically balanced in clusters. It is a cost effective solution because it improves flexibility and reduces the cost on hardware.

2) What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why? 

  Loading the data to MongoLab and connecting the database to the server was easy.

3) What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why? 

   I found little bit difficulty in integration and with the animation as  this was something new.

4) If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern? 

   The biggest concern when using these technologies professionally is how fast the data is retrieved from database when provided with huge datasets.
